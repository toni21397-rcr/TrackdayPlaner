Critical Issues Found
🔴 Priority 0 - Must Fix Before Scale:

Missing Database Indexes - 15+ tables lack indexes on frequently-queried columns (trackdays by track/date, cost items by trackday, etc.). This will cause slow queries as data grows.
No Pagination - List endpoints return all records unbounded (tracks, trackdays, vehicles, tasks). This will exhaust connections with large datasets.
External API Risks - No timeouts/retries on Google Maps, Weather, routing services. A slow provider can block your entire app.
Weather Cache Growth - Cache has no TTL or cleanup, will grow unbounded forever.
🟡 Priority 1 - Important But Can Wait:
5. No Rate Limiting - API is unprotected against abuse or traffic surges.

Limited Caching - Expensive operations (analytics) recalculate on every request.
Basic Error Handling - Many routes lack proper error recovery.
🟢 Priority 2 - Nice to Have:
8. No Data Retention Policy - Need archival strategy for old data (laps, task events, etc.).

Recommended Approach: 3-Phase Implementation
Phase 1 (Critical - Implement Now):

✅ Add 15+ database indexes for hot query paths
✅ Add pagination to largest endpoints (trackdays, maintenance tasks, vehicles)
✅ Add API timeouts/retries via centralized wrapper
✅ Add weather cache TTL + automatic cleanup
✅ Add baseline rate limiting middleware
Estimated effort: 1-2 development sessions
Impact: Handles 1000s of users safely

Phase 2 (Important - Next):

Caching for analytics & dashboards
Expanded error handling
Structured logging for observability
Phase 3 (Polish):

Data retention/archival automation
Advanced monitoring
Queue-based retry system
My Recommendation
I propose implementing Phase 1 immediately. These are the critical fixes that protect your database, prevent resource exhaustion, and handle external API failures gracefully. Without these, you risk:

Slow queries as users add more track days
App crashes when external APIs are slow
Database connection exhaustion
Unbounded storage costs
Would you like me to proceed with Phase 1 implementation now? I'll add the indexes, pagination, API resilience, and cleanup mechanisms. Or if you have specific priorities or timeline constraints, let me know and I can adjust the plan.
