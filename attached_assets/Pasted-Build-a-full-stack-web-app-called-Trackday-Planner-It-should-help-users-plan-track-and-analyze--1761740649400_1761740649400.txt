Build a full-stack web app called “Trackday Planner”.
It should help users plan, track, and analyze their yearly trackdays — including costs, routes, budgets, and performance.

⚙️ Stack

Node.js + Express backend

SQLite database

React + Tailwind frontend

TypeScript

Simple REST API

Map & routing via OpenRouteService or Mapbox (configurable via .env)

🎯 Core Features
1. Trackday Management

Add, edit, and delete trackdays.

Fields: track name, date, duration, vehicle, notes, participation status (planned, registered, attended, cancelled).

Attach cost items (entry, travel, hotel, tires, etc.) with payment status (planned, invoiced, paid, refunded).

Mark events as planned / paid / participated and show colored badges in the list.

Show totals for Projected / Spent / Remaining costs per year.

2. Cost Tracking & Budget

Add multiple cost items per trackday with notes and payment state.

Annual budget setting (CHF).

Total events, total cost, spent vs planned, remaining budget.

Monthly bar chart of spending.

CSV export with all costs and summaries.

3. Route Planner & Travel Costs

Set home location (default Zurich).

Each track has GPS coordinates.

Auto-calculate travel route distance, duration, and estimated fuel + toll cost.

Formula: fuel cost = distance × (consumption / 100) × fuel price.

Show travel distance and cost per trackday and in yearly totals.

4. Vehicles & Maintenance

Manage multiple vehicles (bike, car, etc.) with consumption, fuel type, and notes.

Maintenance log for each vehicle (oil, tires, service, etc.) with date and cost.

Dashboard card: yearly maintenance total.

5. Weather Forecast

Show weather for each trackday (temperature, rain chance, wind) using OpenWeather API.

Auto-refresh or manual “check weather” button.

6. Trackday Timeline & Sessions

For each trackday, show a daily schedule (registration, sessions, breaks, etc.) in a visual timeline.

Add sessions and laps:

Record lap times manually or via CSV import.

Show best lap, average, and trend line.

Optional notes for each session.

7. Overview & Analytics

Dashboard: KPIs + budget progress + charts.

Trackday list: filter by year, participation, or payment status.

Map view: shows tracks, routes, and distances.

Export summary as CSV.
