Copy-paste to Replit Agent

Great — now please implement it end-to-end.
Do the following:

Scaffold & run

Create a Node.js + Express + SQLite backend and a React + Tailwind frontend (TypeScript).

Add REST endpoints for: trackdays, cost items, vehicles, maintenance, routes (recalculate), weather (cache 6h), summary, export CSV.

Start both dev servers concurrently and print the local URLs for API and frontend.

Minimal schema

tracks(id, name, country, lat, lng)

trackdays(id, trackId, date, durationDays, vehicleId, notes, participationStatus)

cost_items(id, trackdayId, type, amountCents, currency, status, dueDate, paidAt, notes, isTravelAuto)

vehicles(id, name, type, fuelType, consumptionPer100, notes)

maintenance_logs(id, vehicleId, date, type, costCents, odometerKm, notes)

trackday_schedule_blocks(id, trackdayId, startTime, endTime, title, type, notes)

track_sessions(id, trackdayId, name, startTime, endTime, bestLapMs, notes)

laps(id, sessionId, lapNumber, lapTimeMs, sectorTimesMsJson, valid)

settings(singleton: currency, homeLat, homeLng, fuelPricePerLitre, tollsPerKm, annualBudgetCents)

Features to build now

Trackdays CRUD with participation: planned/registered/attended/cancelled.

Costs with payment states: planned/invoiced/paid/refunded.

Budget: dashboard cards for Projected / Spent / Remaining + monthly spend chart.

Route calc (OpenRouteService; fallback mock if no key): distance, duration, fuel+tolls estimate stored on the trackday and as cost items (isTravelAuto=true).

Vehicles & maintenance: simple CRUD + yearly maintenance total on dashboard.

Weather (OpenWeather; show widget on trackday; mock if no key).

Timeline & laps: day schedule blocks; sessions with lap table (manual add + CSV import), show best lap.

Filters: by year, participation, payment state.

CSV export: yearly summary + laps export per session.
